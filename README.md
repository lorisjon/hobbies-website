# Meine Hobbys ‚Äì First Website Project

A fully hand-coded website built with **HTML & CSS** as my very first programming project.  
This project was created as my first step into application development, where I planned, designed, and implemented a complete website entirely without using code generators or AI assistance.

## Design & Planning

Before writing any code, I created a detailed **concept document** including a full layout plan, navigation structure, and color scheme selection.  
Here is the original mock-up that guided the development:

You can also view the full concept document here:  
[üìÑ Konzept_Stahlberg_Loris.pdf](./Konzept/Konzept_Stahlberg_Loris.pdf)  

This document (in German) contains:
- A **management summary** of the project goals  
- A **site map** and page structure plan  
- A **design concept** (layout grid, color choices, navigation structure)  
- The **timeline** and project planning steps  

Including it here shows how much planning went into this first project.

## Project Context

This project was my very first experience with developing an application.  
I started with no prior experience in HTML or CSS, learned the basics through two short lessons and a lot of self-study using W3Schools, and gradually became comfortable enough to work mostly independently after a few weeks.  

One of the biggest technical challenges was creating the angled header, sidebar, and footer ‚Äî I solved this by experimenting and eventually using the CSS `skew()` transform.  

I learned not just how to implement a layout and style a website, but also the importance of **planning**, **problem solving**, and later even reflecting on how to improve (for example, I realized the importance of making websites responsive and not hardcoding pixel values).  

> ‚ÄúThe goal was to create a fully functioning, well-designed website from scratch, without relying on code-generating tools.‚Äù

I successfully finished ahead of schedule and earned the top grade of **6.0**, the highest possible grade.
